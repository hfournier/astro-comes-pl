# WordPress to Astro migration CLI

We think that [Astro](https://astro.build/) is a better, faster and safer option for web development than WordPress. And since you've landed here, you probably agree. However, you may have put off migrating your WordPress website, because you expect it to be a huge PITA. We're here to help make that migration much easier, so you can hit the ground running with a fully functioning website. We've intentionally kept [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/brand) styling to a minimum, as you will undoubtedly want to style the site to suit your needs.

To get started, clone this repo to your computer and run the CLI:

```
npm run start
```
